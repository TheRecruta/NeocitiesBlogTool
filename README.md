# NeocitiesBlogTool
A tool to make updating your Neocities blog easier!

This tool is a simple Python script that makes writing blogposts easier for static websites, using the tkinter library to provide an user interface. Data is then stored in a .JSON file, which can then be parsed into your webpage. (An example script will be here, but you'll need to figure out how to implement it in your website).

# How to use
First, you'll need to install the Neocities Python API:
