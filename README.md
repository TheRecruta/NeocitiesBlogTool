# NeocitiesBlogTool
A tool to make updating your Neocities blog easier!

This tool is a simple Python script that makes writing blogposts easier for static websites, using the tkinter library to provide an user interface. Data is then stored in a .JSON file, which can then be parsed into your webpage. (An example script will be here, but you'll need to figure out how to implement it in your website).

### How to use
First, you'll need to install the Neocities Python API:
https://github.com/neocities/python-neocities

After that is done, you must use your Neocities credentials to log into your Neocities account.

And all you need to do is write your Blogpost aaaand boom! posts.json will be automatically uploaded into your Neocities dashboard.

The only thing you'll have to figure out is how to dynamically add the content in posts.json to your website. A JS example will be here in the future.
